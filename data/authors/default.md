Hello! I'm a backend developer with 5+ years of professional experience with JAVA and related technologies.

I am certified in designing, deploying and scaling cloud-based applications using Microsoft Azure.

At my current role I build microservices using Spring Boot and distributed architecture components like Redis, SQL, Kafka, RabbitMQ.

I am contributing to the community through technical writing on open blogging platforms like Dev.to and Hashnode while also helping newbie developers realise their potential through mentoring and guiding them through Discord and Twitter communites.
